I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Florida, advised by Dr. [Zhe Jiang](https://www.jiangteam.org/). Before this, I received my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from Shandong University in 2022, under the supervision of Dr. [Meng Chen](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/chenmeng2). 

My research focuses on data mining and machine learning, with a particular interest in spatiotemporal data in Earth Sciences. I am also passionate about applying AI in healthcare and drug discovery. My work earned the Best Paper Award at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2023 and the Best Paper Runner-Up Award in the Blue Sky Vision Track of SDM 2024.

I’m always excited to explore collaborative opportunities—feel free to reach out!
