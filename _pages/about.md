I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Florida, supervised by Dr. [Zhe Jiang](https://www.jiangteam.org/). Before this, I received my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from Shandong University in 2022, under the supervision of Dr. [Meng Chen](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/chenmeng2). 

My research focuses on data mining and machine learning, with a specialized interest in spatiotemporal data in Earth Sciences. Additionally, I'm interested in AI for healthcare and drug discovery. I am always open to collaborative opportunities, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to me.
